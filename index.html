          <h2>BharatPe founder asks for the removal of CEO from board</h2>
          <p>
            The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has assembled a review
            board that will be tasked with investigating major national
            cybersecurity incidents in an effort to “meaningfully improve” the
            nation’s cyber resilience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), whose creation was set in
            motion by a May 2020 executive order signed by President Biden in
            response to the SolarWinds attack, will be tasked with studying the
            cause and fallout from major hacks so that the government, industry
            and security agencies can better protect national networks and
            infrastructure, according to DHS. The board has been loosely modeled
            on the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which
            investigates air crashes, train derailments and other transportation
            accidents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CSRB’s first review will focus on the vulnerabilities discovered
            in December in the widely used Log4j software library, with a full
            report set to be delivered this summer. Examining these
            vulnerabilities, which are being exploited by a growing set of
            threat actors since details of the vulnerability were made public,
            “will generate many lessons learned for the cybersecurity
            community,” DHS says, adding that the CSRB’s advice, information or
            recommendations will be made public “wherever possible.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The board is composed of 15 members — three times as many as the
            NTSB — made up of cybersecurity leaders from the federal government
            and the private sector. Homeland Security undersecretary for policy
            Robert Silvers will serve as chair, and Google’s security
            engineering chief Heather Adkins will serve as deputy chair.
